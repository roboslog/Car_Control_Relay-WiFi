 Car ignition control relay board

This Car ignition control relay board is very useful to control car to drive the relay with a 3.3v signal of esp8266. Relay connects & disconnects 12v supply of car battery to various components of bike. We have used LM2950 5V voltage regulator to drop down 12v DC supply to 5v DC supply. capacitor added on outer terminal to decrease the noise.
